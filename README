The SquareButton class is a custom SWT widget that can be used in place of 
a native SWT button. Unlike the native button, this should look exactly the 
same on all platforms, which is very helpful when designing tightly spaced 
multi-platform layouts (I'm looking at you, gigantic blue Mac OS X buttons).

Here's a simple example:

		SquareButton myButton = new SquareButton(composite, SWT.NONE);
		myButton.setText("This is my button");
		myButton.addSelectionListener(new SelectionAdapter() {
			public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent event) {
				doSomethingAmazing();    // the click action 
			}
		});

The default button style looks sort of similar to the buttons on the Gmail 
web interface. You can very easily create custom styles that look different. 
Colors can be specified for when the button is unselected, inactive, focused, 
clicked, and hovered over. If two different background colors are specified 
for a given button style, the button background will be a top-to-bottom 
blended gradient of the two colors.

You can also specify a background image to be used, either cropped, centered, 
stretched, tiled, or set such that the button is exactly the size of the 
background image.
